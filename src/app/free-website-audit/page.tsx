const faqs = [
  { q: "Is the website audit really free?", a: "Yes — completely free, no signup and no credit card. Paste your link in the chat and you get your score and top issue immediately. The full report (competitor benchmark, treatment rankings, Google Business comparison) unlocks with just your name and WhatsApp number so we can send it to you." },
  { q: "What does the AI website audit check?", a: "Six things: website speed (real Google PageSpeed data), on-page SEO, patient booking experience (WhatsApp, tap-to-call, online booking), estimated revenue impact, your Google ranking vs. local competitors, and your Google Business Profile compared to the map-pack winners." },
  { q: "Is the audit accurate, or generic advice?", a: "Every finding is backed by real measured data — Google Lighthouse scores, your actual HTML, live Google search results, and your real Google Business listing. Our system is built to never report an issue the data can't prove: if we couldn't verify something, we say so instead of guessing." },
  { q: "Who is this audit for?", a: "It's built for healthcare practices in Blackburn and across the UK — dental clinics, aesthetic clinics, dermatologists, and other doctors — but it works for any business website. The competitor and treatment analysis is tuned for UK local searches and clinics in the nearby towns across the North West and beyond." },
  { q: "How is this different from Google PageSpeed or other free checkers?", a: "Those tools give you a technical score and jargon. Ours translates the same data into patients and dollars, names the actual competitors outranking you, maps your rankings for high-value treatments like implants and braces, and compares your Google Business Profile against local rivals — then tells you what to fix first." },
  { q: "What happens after the audit?", a: "You get the full report right in the chat. If you want the problems fixed, you can book a free strategy call with our team — we build websites, run local SEO, and set up WhatsApp booking for clinics in Blackburn and across the UK. No obligation either way." },

            Why Every Clinic in the UK Should Audit Its Website
          </h2>

            <p>
              Patients in Blackburn, Manchester, London, and nearby towns don&apos;t find their dentist or dermatologist through a signboard anymore — they Google. They search &ldquo;dentist near me&rdquo;, &ldquo;braces near me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;aesthetic clinic near me&rdquo;, compare the top results, check reviews, and message the clinic that makes it easiest. If your website loads slowly, isn&apos;t ranking, or has no WhatsApp or online booking, those patients quietly go to the clinic that does.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <strong>website audit</strong> shows you exactly where that leak is. Our free AI audit combines a <strong>website speed test</strong>, an <strong>SEO check</strong>, a <strong>Google Business Profile comparison</strong>, and a <strong>local competitor analysis</strong> into one plain-English report — built specifically for healthcare practices in Blackburn and across the UK. You&apos;ll see which high-value treatments (implants, braces, veneers, laser treatments) you&apos;re invisible for, which local UK clinics own those searches today, and the shortest path to winning them back.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes 30 seconds, uses real measured data, and costs nothing. The clinics beating you in local UK search results have probably already checked theirs.
