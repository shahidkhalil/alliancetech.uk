  { q: "How long to set up?", a: "Typically 3–5 days. We train it on your clinic, test it, and go live." },
  { q: "Does it work with my existing number?", a: "Yes. We port your existing clinic number or set up a new dedicated line." },

  { q: "How much does an AI receptionist cost for a Houston clinic?", a: "Pricing depends on your call volume and features. For most busy Houston and Texas clinics it costs a fraction of a full-time receptionist's salary while handling far more calls. Book a free demo and we'll quote based on your clinic." },
  { q: "Can it book appointments into my calendar?", a: "Yes. It qualifies the patient, checks the service and preferred time, and books the appointment directly — then confirms by email and WhatsApp, with the booking landing in your system instantly." },
  { q: "Is it only for dental clinics?", a: "No. It works for dental, aesthetic, dermatology, hair transplant, and multi-specialty clinics — any high-volume practice losing patients to missed calls. It's trained on your specific services and prices." },

            <p>
              If your clinic takes dozens of calls a day, your front desk is drowning. During peak hours the line is busy, patients hang up, and every unanswered call is a patient who just booked with the clinic down the road instead. Research shows clinics miss <strong>25–40% of incoming calls</strong> at their busiest — and most callers never try again.
            </p>
            <p>
              An <strong>AI receptionist</strong> removes that ceiling. It answers <strong>every call and website chat at once</strong>, 24/7, in English — no hold music, no voicemail, no missed patients after hours or on weekends. While your staff handles the patient in the chair, the AI handles the twenty patients trying to reach you: answering price and timing questions, qualifying them, and <strong>booking appointments straight into your calendar</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a busy dental, aesthetic, dermatology, or multi-specialty clinic, the math is simple. Recovering even <strong>5 missed bookings a day</strong> — at an average patient value of $500 — is over <strong>$40,000 a month</strong> in appointments you were already paying marketing to generate but losing at the phone. That&apos;s the leak an AI receptionist closes.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also cuts your <strong>no-show rate</strong> with automatic confirmations and reminders, and gives you a record of every conversation — so you finally see how many patients are calling after hours. It works alongside your existing staff and phone number, not instead of them: your team stops firefighting the phone and starts closing high-value treatments.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built this for clinics right here in <strong>Blackburn, UK</strong> — and across Manchester, London, Birmingham, and beyond — where patients are searching &ldquo;dentist near me&rdquo; or &ldquo;AI answering service UK&rdquo; and expect an instant reply. If you&apos;re a dental, aesthetic, or medical practice anywhere in the UK, our <strong>AI receptionist</strong> is trained on your services and hours from day one, so every caller gets a fast, accurate answer — not a busy signal.
