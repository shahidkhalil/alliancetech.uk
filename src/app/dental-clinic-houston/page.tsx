            <p>
              Patients in Houston often contact several dental clinics before choosing where to book. When a
              call is missed, a WhatsApp message sits unanswered, or a website inquiry waits until the next
              business day, that patient may schedule elsewhere. Busy front-desk teams cannot always respond
              instantly while also supporting patients inside the clinic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alliance Tech builds AI automation for dental clinics in Houston, TX. Our systems can answer
              approved questions, collect patient details, qualify treatment interest, support appointment
              requests, and follow up with leads across phone, website, and WhatsApp channels. The automation
              supports your staff; it does not diagnose patients or replace clinical judgment.
